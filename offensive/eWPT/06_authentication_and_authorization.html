<h3> 06.authentication and authorization  </h3>

>>> portswigger: 

https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication

is the process of determining whether someone is really who they claim to be. for example, webapps often rely on username & password pair for this. 

authentication factor represent something the user owns, know, or is. 

authentication factors: something the user has / something the user knows / something the user is.

single factor, means that the user only need to provide one of the 3 factors we saw. typical single factor is the user to provide the password.

two factor, MFA. requires a user to provide two or more of the three authentication factors. sample, the ATM machine, you will need to provide two factors, something you have: the credit card and something you know, the pin.

if a password does not adhere to a strong password policy, it is exposed to attacks such as:

-dictionary attack | can be language oriented, role oriented, etc. | the goal is to guess passwords by selecting words from the dictionary.

-brute-force attack | tries to use every possible combination of characters to guess the password. takes time, will be good to use this attack only if the dictionary attack did not work. number of attempts depends upon the character domain and password length (charset)

sample: if the character domain is [a-zA-Z0-9] and the password length is 8, the max numbers of attempts will be 62^8.

common wordlists:

-STRONG PASSWORD POLICY

==> length: at least 10 characters
==> never use the same password twice
==> composition (at least one uppercase char / one lower / one digit / special character)
==> do not include personal information and dictionary words
==> change password regularly (monthly, annually)

-STORING HASHES

from server-side perspective, passwords must never be stored in clear text. passwords need to be hashed (preferably with a salt) before they are stored. 

-LOCKOUT/BLOCKING REQUESTS

to avoid brute force and dictionaty attacks, system can be designed to block the access. typical example of good system design:
-* adds and incrementing delay after each failed login attempt
-* after 3 failed attempts show a CAPTCHA puzzle
-* after 10 failed attempts, locks the user for a certain amount of time. 

-USER ENUMERATION

authentication mechanics accept a user identifier and a secret word (pass), know by only the user. 
badly designed system can reveal sensitive information about the existence of a user. example, an app can reveal the existence of a user. determinig valid usernames is something not considered serious threat, users are half of what is needed.

samples: enumerate via error messages
-login for user foo: invalid password
-login failed, invalid user ID
-login failed, account disabled
-login failed, this user is not active

handle exception ?

-login failed; invalid user ID or password

... USER ENUMERATION VIA WEBSITE BEHAVIOR

some apps may not display the previous messages but have a distinct behavior on user existence. if that behavior is identified, it can be attacked via user enumeration. 
samples:
user does not exist: cookies are deleted / user goes to a known fixed page / the HTML is fixed

user exists: cookies are not deleted or a new cookie is set / user goes to a user-specific page / the HTML changes or is different from an invalid-user

....USER ENUMERATION VIA TIMING ATTACKS

there will be two most common behaviors, 
-user does not exist in the DB: show error + abort
-user exists in the DB: retrieve user, calculate password, check if the password matches.
because of this, it may possible to perform user enumeration by timing how long it takes to the applicaton to send a response. 
this can be exploited and allow and attacker to discover whether a user is present on the system. 

ADVANTAGE OF USER ENUMERATION

once this info is available to the attacker, it can be performed any attack requiring the username component:
- a dictionary (or brute force) attack agains the password to discover the user's password
- a password reset for that user if the system suffers from a weakness in the password reset feature.

in order to perform user enumeration, a login page should return different messages based on the submittal of a pair of: (asumming we dont know the password)
-correct username / wrong password
-wrong username / wrong password
now that it is needed to check for differences, "burp comparer" can be used to compare responses. 

... REMEMBER FUNCTIONALITY

after a successful authentication, the web app does not ask the user to log in(usually for a period of time). 
this function can be implemented through the following methods:
-through the browser cache
-by storing credentials permanently within the web storage
-by storing the credentials within a cookie
