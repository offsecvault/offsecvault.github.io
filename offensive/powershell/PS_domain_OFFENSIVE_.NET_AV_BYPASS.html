<a href="https://github.com/matterpreter/DefenderCheck">DEFENDER CHECK</a> can be used to detect code and 
strings from a binary that windows defender may flag as malicious.

usage:

PS> DefenderCheck.exe [file]

>>> STRING MANIPULATION

the sample way is to edit the code using an IDE, sample, visual studio.
for example, some triggers are associated to the words "credentials", so the basic way to bypass this 
is replacing the trigger word with another word, sample: "Credents". (remember to replace in all code")
run DefenderCheck until there's no flags.
